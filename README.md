# Portfolio - PLEASE readme before going any further!

Source code for prior projects

The folders and files in this directory are a collection of my personal projects dating back to the late 1990's. This is to be considered a part of my personal portfolio.

Some of this code is very old and the standards of what certain compilers will and will not recognize has changed multiple times over the years.

Do with the code here what you will, however keep in mind that, as per usual:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Basically, I wrote some of this code a LONG time ago. Some of the code here will delete files, etc. Compile and run anything here AT YOUR OWN RISK!
